# ESP32
Hosting code while playing with a Heltec ESP32-S3. It has an OLED screen attached and a small wifi module to play with, as well as GPIO pins to solder headers to and use as part of a project.

This is just for personal exploration and getting things running in my environment, not part of any particular project.
